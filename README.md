# IFN680_A2
Warped Image Classification using Siamese Networks

This Project was completed as part of IFN680 Advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence.

The Siamese network was trained and tested using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. In order to simulate camera angle changes, the images were warped uniformly and then tested. This report will outline a structure for a Siamese network, and the optimal training methods to allow the network to recognise objects from a range of angles.
